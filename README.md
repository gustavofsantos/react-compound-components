# React Scratchpad

The fastest way to get started scratching some React with tests.

## Getting Started

```
$ npx degit gustavofsantos/react-scratchpad demo
$ cd demo
$ yarn install
$ yarn test
```

Code and tests are located at the same place in the directory `/code`. Feel free to delete, update or reuse that example code.
